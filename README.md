LeapMotionFingerCursor
======================

A jumpstart for using a 2d cursor tied to a finger in LeapMotion

This project illustrates several things useful for LeapMotion interaction:

* the ability to attach a 2d sprite to the 3D LeapMotion data
* the ability to use exponential smoothing to patch the "roughness" of the tracking in Leap. 
* the ability to "freeze" the cursor during pinching. 

This project is a library for building menus etc. using the leap motion tracker. 

## PinchMenu

This library includes a pinch menu that is the equivalent of the classic "Leap Motion Radial Menu" with pinch driving
